I"i<p>Questions are often seen (incorrectly) in many scenarios as illuminating one’s lack of understanding. I mean you are asking a question because you didn’t fully understand some information presented to you, right?</p>

<p>Questions are much more nuanced than they might seem in the form described above, a form which acts as a barrier for many people to ask questions in the first place. I view questions as one of the most powerful tools for understanding topics deeply, demonstrating knowledge, and having awareness.</p>

<p>Obsessive question asking keeps your mind on edge and rewards naivety. There are questions that may seem so base or fundamental at the surface many people overlook them and consequently having a harder time answering them. By asking these fundamental questions you put yourself in a postition to understand topics from the bottom up when it certain aspects have already been placed in “common knowledge”.</p>

<p>Amongst children, there is a phase where they ask questions about the world in this obsessive way, as for them it is the only way to learn about why things are the way they are. As one gets older, however, question asking tends to slowly subside, due to much more consideration of how questions might be perceived by others. 
While it is an important consideration, don’t let it obstruct you’re own internal thought processes where these questions intially come up.</p>

<p>With that said, be the person in the room that asks the questions nobody else will, in the minimum case it just further reaffirms understanding, in the best case it changes one’s understanding. So, ask on.</p>
