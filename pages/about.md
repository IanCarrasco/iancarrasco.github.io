I'm an experienced software engineer who's worked across several domains including data science, machine learning, and full stack. In university, I studied neuroscience and computer science and have always been interested in the intersection between the two especially as it comes to building more efficient, biologically plausible artificial intelligence. When I'm not thinking about engineering, I'm an avid musician and producer.


### Work Experience
---

#### Software Engineer @ Google | <span class="blue">Present</span>
>Working on the next generation of maps.

#### ML Engineering Intern @ ServiceNow | <span class="blue">Summer 2020</span>
>Performed benchmarks and experimented with runtime improvements for document clustering using Python.
>Prototyped an asynchronous training job manager integrating Servicenow's AI offerings using Python and Falcon.

#### Software Engineering Intern @ Google | <span class="blue">Winter 2020</span>
>Researched the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) using Tensorflow. Developed a novel architecture based on dilated convolutions for generation of images that require spatial context, produced qualitatively better results than Pix2Pix.

#### Systems Engineering Intern @ ServiceNow | <span class="blue">Summer 2019</span>
>Developed domain-specific modeling techniques for anomaly detection in mail
>server logs using Splunk and Python. Additionally, built a notification system using the Slack API to reduce incident triage times from several days to ~2 hours.
 
#### Software Engineering Intern @ HERE Maps | <span class="blue">Summer 2018</span> 
>Integrated React and MobX to visualize high frequency car sensor data for car manufacturers to simulate road hazard events and analyze specific product offerings.
