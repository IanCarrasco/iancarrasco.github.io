- Neurons represent and transmit informatiion by firing sequences of spikes in various temporal patterns
- Different stimuli and actions → Different firing patterns
- Two Views of Stimulus Response
    - Map from stimulus → response (Neural Encoding)
        - Predict how brain will fire in response to certain stimuli
    - Map from response → stimulus (Neural Decoding)
        - Predict what stimulus or action the brain is doing from firing patterns
- Morphology of Neurons
    - Dendrites: Receive input from other neurons
    - Axon: Sends output to other cells
    - Different neurons have different configurations of dendrites
    - A - Cortical Pyramidal Cell , B - Purkinje Cell (cerebellum), C - Stellate Cell (interneuron - inhibitory)

- Physiology of Neurons
    - Ion channels in the cell membrane that allow ions in/out of the cell including
        - Sodium (Na+)
        - Potassium (K+)
        - Calcium (Ca2+)
        - Chloride (Cl-)
    - Ion channels open and close in response to voltage changes in the neuron and internal and external signals
- Membrane Potential
	- Main electrical signal of relevance in the brain
	- The internal membrane potential at rest is ~ -70mV relative to the outside of the cell.  (Polarized State)
	- Concentration gradients (concentrations of different ions in/out of the cell)
	- Ion pumps maintain the concentration that keeps the membrane potential -70mV
	- Ions flow in and out of a cell due to
		- Voltage Gradients
		- Concentration Gradients
	-  The neuron can become hyperpolarized via positive ions leaving the cell or negative ions flowing in.
	- Depolarization is the opposite effect where positive ions flow into the cell or negative ions leave
	- Sufficient Depolarization -> Action Potential
- Action Potential
	- Neuron is depolarized -> raising membrane potential above a threshold -> postive feedback loop -> causes a ~100mV fluctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane for 1ms 
	- After an action potential fires, there is an absolute refractory period of a few milliseconds
		- Relative refractory period can be 10x that
	- Action potentials are the only form of membrane potential  fluctuation that can propagate over large distances.
			- Sub-threshold potentials get attenuated over distances of 1mm
- Synapses
	- Action potential causes ion channels to open leading to Ca2+ to enter causing NTs to be released
	- Depending on ion flow synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory effect on the post synaptic cell
- Stimulus to Neural Response mapping is hard to determine and non-deterministic, but rather look for models that can account for probabilities of spike sequences in response to a specific stimulus
