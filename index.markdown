# Hi, I'm Ian.
I am software engineer interested in developing biologically inspired deep learning algorithms.

Additionally, I am working to develop systems that can accelerate the adoption of deep learning in new domains and improve productivity.

When I'm not thinking about deep learning and the mind, I produce music, build software, and play sports.
